montecarlo-plasma
=================

Simple Markov chain Monte Carlo implementation for two component Coulomb plasma.
Periodical boundary conditions.

This code uses good random algorithm: http://www.cs.gmu.edu/~sean/research/

It's made for multithreaded running of a set of point simultaneously.

Written for Java 7.

BTW, it works fast, really fast!

I mean, much faster than the same code written in C++ and compiled by GCC 4,
both on Mac OS X (Intel Core i7) and Windows 7 (Inter Core 2 Duo).
